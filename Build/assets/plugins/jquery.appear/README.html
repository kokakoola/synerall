<h1>jQuery.appear</h1>

<p>This is a total revamp of original jquery.appear plugin hosted on http://code.google.com/p/jquery-appear/</p>

<p>Check <a href="http://morr.github.com/appear.html">demo page</a>!</p>

<p>This plugin can be used to prevent unnecessary processeing for content that is hidden or is outside of the browser viewport.</p>

<p>It implements a custom <em>appear</em>/<em>disappear</em> events which are fired when an element became visible/invisible in the browser viewport.</p>

<pre><code>    $('someselector').appear(); // It supports optinal hash with "force_process" and "interval" keys. Check source code for details.

    $('&lt;div&gt;test&lt;/div&gt;').appear(); // It also supports raw DOM nodes wrapped in jQuery.

    $('someselector').on('appear', function(event, $all_appeared_elements) {
      // this element is now inside browser viewport
    });
    $('someselector').on('disappear', function(event, $all_disappeared_elements) {
      // this element is now outside browser viewport
    });
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to fire <em>appear</em> event for elements which are close to vieport but are not visible yet, you may add data attributes <em>appear-top-offset</em> and <em>appear-left-offset</em> to DOM nodes.</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;div class="postloader" data-appear-top-offset="600"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt; # appear will be fired when an element is below browser viewport for 600 or less pixels
</code></pre>

<p>Appear check can be forced by calling <em>$.force_appear()</em>. This is suitable in cases when page is in initial state (not scrolled and not resized) and when you want manually trigger appearance check.</p>

<p>Also this plugin provides custom jQuery filter for manual checking element appearance.</p>

<pre><code>    $('someselector').is(':appeared')
</code></pre>
