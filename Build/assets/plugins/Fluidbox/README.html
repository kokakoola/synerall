<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Fluidbox was initially a simple personal challenge I set myself, with two simple aims — to replicate the distraction-free, fluid lightbox seen on <a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a>, and to improve on it such that it will allow linking to a larger-resolution image. The plugin deals with higher resolution, linked images elegantly, such that it only preloads them when users click on the thumbnails, therefore conserving bandwidth usage for your visitors and your server(s).</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://medium.com/coding-design/9c7fe9db92c7">read my article on Medium</a> about how I got inspiration for this little project of mine, and the basic mechanisms behind the plugin. Some serious math is involved (<em>nah, not really</em>).</p>

<p>Moreover, you can <a href="http://terrymun.github.io/Fluidbox/">visit the demo of this plugin</a> on the project page hosted with GitHub. The plugin version 1.22 and onwards (uncompressed, minified and its associated CSS file) is hosted with <a href="http://cdnjs.com/libraries/fluidbox/">CDNJS</a>.</p>

<h2>Changelog</h2>
<p>| Version | Comments |
|———|———-|
| 1.2.0   | Official release |
| 1.2.1   | Minor bug fixes |
| 1.2.2   | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;<strong>Bug fix:</strong> Changed positioning of overlay, to ensure that it works in pages with absolutely- or relatively-positioned parent/wrapper elements with z-indexs specified&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;<strong>Update:</strong> Fluidbox is now available via <a href="http://cdnjs.com/libraries/fluidbox/">CDNJS</a>.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; |
| 1.2.3   | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;<strong>Bug fix:</strong> Fixed the iamge switching issue when Fluidbox is closed, which causes two flashes of white. This is done by listening to the <code>transitionend</code> property, with a tiny hack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;<strong>Update:</strong> JS is minifised using <a href="http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/uglifyjs">UglifyJS</a> instead of the <a href="http://refresh-sf.com/yui/">YUI compressor</a>, saving a wee bit more bandwidth for you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; |
| 1.2.4α | <strong>Warning: Buggy, alpha-build</strong><br />&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;<strong>Bug fix:</strong> Removed the white flash issue by rearranging how overlay is appended to the DOM tree. Users can change the z-index in the CSS file freely (to suit their layout needs), as the script will store the original assigned z-index in a HTML5 <code>data-</code> attribute for manipulation, in order to restore the original z-index&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;<strong>License notice:</strong> Switched from GNU to MIT.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; |
| 1.2.5   | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;<strong>Bug fix:</strong> Minimized white flash issue and fixed the stacking order bug introduced in v1.2.4α. A new option is now available, known as <code>stackIndex</code>. It is set to <code>999</code> by default, but if you have other absolutely positioned elements on the page that you want to overlay, you can change this option (alternatively, modify/lower the <code>z-index</code> of offending elements).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;<strong>Update:</strong> Included the updated licenses in <code>license.md</code> and <code>license.txt</code>.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; |
| 1.2.6   | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;<strong>Bug fix:</strong> Replaced the use of <code>transitionend</code> event detection for timing effects, due to the fact that the event lacks cross-browser support and standardization. This issue is particularly bad for Firefox, which showed that the <code>transitionend</code> is not triggered properly, causing parts of the plugin to break. I have chosen to fall back to the native JS’ <code>setTimeout</code> and <code>clearTimeout</code> functions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; |
| 1.2.7   | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;<strong>Bug fix:</strong> Fixed issues when the <code>.one()</code> event is not propery unbound, especially after rapid, successive clicking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;<strong>Update:</strong> Added a new option called <code>stackIndexDelta</code>, where you can dictate how much the z-index should change when Fluidbox is toggled. The default is set to 10. If you have a lot of absolutely positioned elements on the page, you might want to increase this delta value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; |
| 1.3.0   | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;<strong>Update:</strong> Authored by <a href="https://github.com/hybernaut">@hybernaut</a>. Removes dependency on imagesLoaded for a speedier performance — instead, listens to <code>.load()</code> event on each individual Fluidbox thumbnail separately when triggering Fluidbox. Click handler has been migrated to a separate function to aid clarity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;<strong>Bug fix:</strong> The resize function used to check for the presence of <code>a[data-fluidbox]</code>, which might not be present if users choose other ways to identify Fluidbox thumbnails. Selector has been updated to the universal <code>a.fluidbox.fluidbox-opened</code>.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; |
| 1.3.1   | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;<strong>Update &amp; bug fix:</strong> Removed timer in JS, and rely on CSS3’s very own <code>transition-delay</code> instead. This fixes the issue of rapid clicking causing the enlarged image not showing up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; |
| 1.3.2   | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;<strong>Update:</strong> Added support for borders and paddings on Fluidbox images.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; |
| 1.3.3   | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;<strong>Bug fix:</strong> Added transition delay to thumbnail.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; |</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To install Fluidbox, you will have to include the following resources in your page. The JS files should be loaded in the order stipulated below. For the CSS file, you can either incorporate it with your site’s stylesheet, or load it externally through the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element in <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>File Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>JS</td>
      <td><a href="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js">jQuery 1.x</a></td>
      <td><strong>External Dependency</strong>: The <em>latest verson</em> of jQuery 1.x library is needed for Fluidbox functionality.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>JS</td>
      <td><code>jquery.fluidbox.js</code></td>
      <td>Confers the main functionality of Fluidbox. Alternatively, you can load the minified version, <code>jquery.fluidbox.min.js</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>CSS</td>
      <td><code>css/fluidbox.css</code></td>
      <td>Offers styles that are crucial for the correct display of Fluidbox. The appearance will break if this is not included.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>### Basic
It is rather straightforward to use Fluidbox — simply chain the <code>.fluidbox()</code> method to a selector of your choice. The plugin will automatically check if the selector is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An anchor element</li>
  <li>Contains one and <em>only</em> one child</li>
  <li>The only children is an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element</li>
</ol>

<p>In the event that the element that satisfies the selector criteria but failed any one of the above criteria, the element will be ignored and the plugin moves on to the next available element. Therefore, it is important that your Fluidbox element(s) follow the following format. The <code>title</code> and <code>alt</code> attributes of the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element is not used by the plugin, but the <code>alt</code> attribute has to be present for it to be semantically valid.</p>

<p><code>html
&lt;a href="..."&gt;
    &lt;img src="..." alt="" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
</code></p>

<p>In your JS file, you can simply chain the <code>.fluidbox()</code> method to your selector on DOM ready:</p>

<p><code>js
$(function () {
    $('.gallery a, a[rel="lightbox"]').fluidbox();
})
</code></p>

<h3>Dynamically-added elements</h3>
<p>In order to enable Fluidbox functionality to dynamically-added content, you will have to apply <code>.fluidbox()</code> to the element of interest after appending it to the DOM. For example, let’s say clicking a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> triggers the addition of a new image:</p>

<p>```js
$(function() {
    $(‘button’).click(function(e) {
        e.preventDefault();</p>

<pre><code>    // Construct new image
    var $newContent = $('&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a new image that is dynamically-added to the page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://placehold.it/500x500" title="" data-fluidbox&gt;&lt;img src="http://placehold.it/200x200" alt="Alternate Text" title="Image Title" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;');
    
    // Insert new content object into DOM, and then apply .fluidbox to it
    $(this).after($newContent).next().find('a[data-fluidbox]').fluidbox();
}); )); ```
</code></pre>

<p>You are of course welcome to use other ways to manipulate and/or transverse the DOM, but you will have to adjust the search/filter function (using <code>.find()</code> or other similar jQuery methods) to retrieve the newly inserted content and search for the element of interest where you want Fluidbox to work with.</p>

<h3>Some precautions</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Overflowing content.</strong> Fluidbox may not work properly in the event that you have set your parent container, or content wrapping elements, such as <code>&lt;div id="#content"&gt;</code> and the likes, to hide their overflowing content, i.e. <code>overflow: hidden</code>. This is because the enlarged image is <strong>positioned relatively to its hyperlink</strong>, and not absolutely or fixed within the viewport.</li>
  <li><strong>Interaction with other positioned elements on the same page.</strong> When you want an absolutely/fixed-positioned element on the page to not be obscured by the dynamically-generated wrapping element, you should use a z-index of between 1000 to 1010. 1000 is set as the default <code>stackIndex</code> of Fluidbox, while 10 is set as the default <code>stackIndexDelta</code>, which is toggled on/off depending on the state of the Fluidbox. These settings can be individually tuned, see <strong>Configuration</strong> below.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>Fluidbox can be configured according to your needs. The following options are available:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Option</th>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Default value</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>viewportFill</code></td>
      <td>Numerical</td>
      <td><code>0.95</code></td>
      <td>Dictates how much the longest axis of the image should fill the viewport. The default value will make the image fill 95% of the viewport dimension along its longest axis</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>overlayColor</code></td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td><code>rgba(255,255,255,.85)</code></td>
      <td>Sets the <code>background-color</code> property of Fluidbox overlay. Defaults to white with an opacity of 0.85.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>debounceResize</code></td>
      <td>Boolean</td>
      <td><code>true</code></td>
      <td>Dictates if the <code>$(window).resize()</code> event should be debounced for performance reason. This feature leverages the <a href="http://www.paulirish.com/2009/throttled-smartresize-jquery-event-handler/">small snippet kindly provided by Paul Irish</a>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>closeTrigger</code></td>
      <td>Array</td>
      <td><em>see below</em></td>
      <td>Dictates what event triggers closing of an opened Fluidbox. The default setup binds the click handler to the overlay.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>stackIndex</code></td>
      <td>Integer</td>
      <td><code>999</code></td>
      <td>Determines how high up the z-index will all Fluildbox elements be. Leave this option as default, unless you have other relatively or absolutely positioned elements on the page that is messing with Fluidbox appearance.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Note on <code>closeTrigger</code> option</h4>
<p>The default setup will have the effect of binding the click event to the overlay, so that when user click on the overlay, the Fluidbox instance that is opened will be closed:</p>

<p><code>js
// Default option
closeTrigger: [
    {
        selector: '#fluidbox-overlay',
        event: 'click'
    },
    {
        selector: 'document',
        event: 'keyup',
        keyCode: 27
    }
]
</code></p>

<hr />

<p>It is also possible to bind other events to trigger the same effect. For example, if you would want to close the Fluidbox when the viewport is resized, you can do the following:</p>

<p><code>js
$(function () {
    $('a').fluidbox({
        closeTrigger: [
            { selector: '#fluidbox-overlay', event: 'click'  },
            { selector: 'window',            event: 'resize' }
        ]
    });
});
</code></p>

<p>This will have the effect of doing so (where <code>closeFb</code> is the internal function in the plugin needed to close any opened Fluidbox):</p>

<p><code>js
$(document).on('click', '#fluidbox-overlay', closeFb);
$(window).on('resize', closeFb);
</code></p>

<hr />

<p>You can even bind event to multiple selectors, and vice versa. The syntax of dictating so is similar to constructing event handler binding using the <code>.on()</code> method, so if you are <a href="http://api.jquery.com/on/">familiar with its use</a>, dictating your own closeTrigger should not be too difficult:</p>

<p><code>js
$(function () {
    $('a').fluidbox({
        closeTrigger: [
            { selector: '#fluidbox-overlay', event: 'click'         },
            { selector: 'window',            event: 'resize scroll' },
            { selector: '#ele1, #ele2',      event: 'hover'         }
        ]
    });
});
</code></p>

<p>This will have the effect of doing so:</p>

<p><code>js
$(document).on('click', '#fluidbox-overlay', closeFb);
$(window).on('resize', closeFb);
$(document).on('hover', '#ele1, #ele2', closeFb)
</code></p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>As Fluidbox relies on CSS transforms, it only works with thumbnails that share the same aspect ratio with their higher resolution counterparts, otherwise the larger image will be cropped off, i.e. a square thumbnail linking to a landscape photo will cause the landscape photo to appear in a square frame. Fluidbox, serving as an alternative lightbox module, also assume that the image you have linked contains sufficient resolution to be displayed on the monitor — low resolution images will scale poorly on a large display.</p>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>Fluidbox require the following dependencies in order to function properly — you will have to include them in your page, if you want Fluidbox to work:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The latest release of jQuery 1.x</strong> (minimum requirement: jQuery &gt;1.7), available from <a href="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js">Google’s jQuery API</a> at <code>http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the <strong>imagesloaded jQuery plugin</strong> is no longer required as of v1.2.8 and above.</p>

<p>Fluidbox allows you to throttle the <code>$(window).resize()</code> event, and this is only possible with <a href="http://www.paulirish.com/2009/throttled-smartresize-jquery-event-handler/">Paul Irish’s debounced resize function</a>. The small script has been included in the plugin by default, but I would like to extend my gratitude to Paul for making it available, and for allowing me to include it in this plugin.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Quesitons</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fluidbox is not working in my installation. Where should I start?</strong><br />
Start by checking your browser’s console log. What error messages do you see? Also, make sure that you are using the <em>latest</em> version of jQuery 1.x (minimum requirement: v1.8 or above) and that the dependencies have been loaded successfully.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Do you plan to implement [insert feature]?</strong><br />
Fluidbox is conceived as a means to simplify lightboxes. Therefore, I plan to keep Fluidbox as simple as it is, without additional features, such as captioning (there are other limitations to this, too) and gallery features. However, you can always fork and modify Fluidbox to your perosnal liking.</p>
