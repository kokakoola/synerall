<h2>Submitting Pull Requests</h2>

<p><strong>Please follow these basic steps to simplify pull request reviews - if you don’t you’ll probably just be asked to anyway.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Please rebase your branch against the current master</li>
  <li>Run <code>npm install</code> to make sure your development dependencies are up-to-date</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli">grunt-cli</a> &gt;= 0.4.0 is required to sanity check your contribution</li>
  <li>Please ensure that the test suite passes <strong>and</strong> that bootbox.js is lint free before submitting a PR by running:</li>
  <li><code>grunt</code></li>
  <li>If you’ve added new functionality, <strong>please</strong> include tests which validate its behaviour</li>
  <li><strong>this includes pull requests which <em>only</em> add new locales!</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Submitting bug reports</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Where at all possible, please try and provide a link to a jsfiddle.net example or similar</li>
  <li>Please detail the affected browser(s) and operating system(s)</li>
  <li>Please be sure to state which version of Bootbox, jQuery <strong>and</strong> Bootstrap you’re using</li>
</ul>
