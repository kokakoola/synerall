<h1>MixItUp</h1>

<h3>What is MixItUp?</h3>

<p>MixItUp is a jQuery plugin providing animated filtering and sorting.</p>

<p>MixItUp is great for managing any categorized or ordered content like portfolios, galleries and blogs, but can also function as a powerful tool for engaging application UI and data-visualisation.</p>

<h3>Why MixItUp?</h3>

<p>MixItUp plays nice with your existing HTML and CSS, making it a great choice for responsive layouts.</p>

<p>Rather than using absolute positioning to control layout, MixItUp is designed to work with your existing inline-flow layout. Want to use percentages, media queries, inline-block, or even flex box? No problem!</p>

<h3>Basic Overview</h3>

<p>For a getting started guide, tutorials, documentation and support, please visit the MixItUp website at <a href="https://mixitup.kunkalabs.com">mixitup.kunkalabs.com</a></p>

<p>A typical MixItUp workflow looks like this:</p>

<h4>HTML</h4>

<p>Build your container:</p>

<p><code>
&lt;div id="Container"&gt;
	&lt;div class="mix category-1" data-my-order="1"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div class="mix category-1" data-my-order="2"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div class="mix category-2" data-my-order="3"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div class="mix category-2" data-my-order="4"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>
&gt; MixItUp targets elements with the class <code>mix</code> inside a container. Categories for filtering are added as classes, and sort attributes are added as custom data attributes.</p>

<p>Build your filter controls:</p>

<p><code>
&lt;button class="filter" data-filter=".category-1"&gt;Category 1&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button class="filter" data-filter=".category-2"&gt;Category 2&lt;/button&gt;
</code>
&gt; Filtering happens when filter buttons are clicked.</p>

<p>Build your sort controls:</p>

<p><code>
&lt;button class="sort" data-sort="my-order:asc"&gt;Ascending Order&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button class="sort" data-sort="my-order:desc"&gt;Descending Order&lt;/button&gt;
</code>
&gt; Sorting happens when sort buttons are clicked.</p>

<h4>CSS</h4>

<p>Hide target elements:
<code>
#Container .mix{
	display: none;
}
</code>
&gt; In your project’s stylesheet, set the display property of target elements to <code>none</code>. MixItUp will show only those elements which match the current filter.</p>

<h4>JS</h4>

<p>Instantiate MixItUp on your container using jQuery:</p>

<p><code>
$(function(){
	$('#Container').mixItUp();	
});
</code>
&gt; Using our container’s ID, we can instantiate MixItUp with the jQuery method <code>.mixItUp()</code></p>

<h3>Support &amp; Bugs</h3>

<p>Support forums are provided at <a href="https://mixitup.kunkalabs.com/support">mixitup.kunkalabs.com/support</a></p>

<p>We ask that all general support questions and issues are posted there and that GitHub issues be used <em>only</em> for bug-related issues. All non-bug-related issues posted to GitHub will be closed without comment.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Please be patient while we respond to your questions as we have very limited  resources. The support forum is provided as a courtesy to MixItUp users so that knowledge can be shared – support is not guaranteed.</li>
  <li>Please be as detailed as possible when posting. If you can include a link to your project, a CodePen or JSFiddle demo, or a even just a code snippet of your setup, it is much more likely your question will be answered quickly and correctly.</li>
  <li>Do not email KunkaLabs with support questions. All support emails will be ignored.</li>
  <li>If you think you’ve found a bug we encourage you to submit a GitHub Issue rather than posting in the support forums. This way we can keep bugs tracked efficiently and hopefully fix them swiftly.</li>
  <li>When submitting a bug report please provide as much details as possible about your development environment, browser and OS, and the expected vs. resulting behaviour. Please also include any console errors that arise.</li>
  <li>If you can pinpoint the erroneous code even better. Pull requests are always appreciated.</li>
</ul>
