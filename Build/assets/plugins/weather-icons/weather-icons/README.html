<h1>Weather Icons</h1>
<p><em>Version Beta 1 - August 3rd 2013</em></p>

<p>These are the Bootstrap ready Less files. Put the “weather-icons” folder inside your main Less folder and import it with the rest of your less imports.</p>

<p><strong>Remember</strong> your CSS is going to look for the fonts in <code>./css</code>, a directory above. </p>
