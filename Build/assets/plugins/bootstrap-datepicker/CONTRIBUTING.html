<h2>Support requests</h2>

<p>The issue tracker is not the place for support requests.  If you get stuck with bootstrap-datepicker, it’s very likely that the fine folks at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> will be able to help you; simply describe the problem you’re having and provide them a link to the repo (so they know what code you’re using).  Another option is to post to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/bootstrap-datepicker">bootstrap-datepicker google group</a>.</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

<p>If you’ve found a bug in bootstrap-datepicker, we want to know about it!  However, please keep the following in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This is not the bootstrap-datepicker from <a href="http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-datepicker/">eyecon.ro</a>.  Stefan provided the initial code for bootstrap-datepicker, but this repo is divergent from his codebase.  Please make sure you’re using either the latest tagged version or the latest master from https://github.com/eternicode/bootstrap-datepicker/ .</li>
  <li>A working example of the bug you’ve found is <em>much</em> easier to work with than a  description alone.  If possible, please provide a link to a demonstration of the bug, perhaps using http://jsfiddle.net/ .</li>
  <li>Finally, it’s possible someone else has already reported the same bug you have.  Please search the issue tracker for similar issues before posting your own.  Thanks!</li>
</ul>
