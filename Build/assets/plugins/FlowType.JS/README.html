<h1>FlowType.JS</h1>

<p>Responsive web typography at its finest: font-size ~~and line-height~~ based on element width.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://simplefocus.com/flowtype">demo site</a>.</p>

<h2>What does FlowType.JS do?</h2>

<p>Ideally, the most legible typography contains <a href="http://webtypography.net/Rhythm_and_Proportion/Horizontal_Motion/2.1.2/">between 45 and 75 characters per line</a>. This is difficult to accomplish for all screen widths with only CSS media-queries. FlowType.JS eases this difficulty by changing the font-size ~~and line-height~~ based on a specific element’s width. This allows for a perfect character count per line at any screen width.</p>

<h2>Options</h2>

<h3>Thresholds</h3>

<p>Set minimum and maximum width thresholds to control the FlowType.JS magic within specific element widths.</p>

<p>In this example, FlowType.JS will stop resizing text once the element width becomes smaller than 500px or larger than 1200px.</p>

<p><code>javascript
$('body').flowtype({
   minimum : 500,
   maximum : 1200
});
</code></p>

<p>Set minimum and maximum font-size thresholds to control the FlowType.JS magic within specific font sizes.</p>

<p>In this example, FlowType.JS will stop resizing text once the font-size becomes smaller than 12px or larger than 40px.</p>

<p><code>javascript
$('body').flowtype({
   minFont : 12,
   maxFont : 40
});
</code></p>

<h3>Font-size</h3>

<p>Set your own font-size using the <code>fontRatio</code> variable. When using <code>fontRatio</code>, increase the value to make the font smaller (and vice versa).</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> Because each font is different, you will need to “tweak” <code>fontSize</code> and “eye ball” your final product to make sure that your character count is within the recommended range.</p>

<p>~~Line-height (<code>lineRatio</code>) is set based on the <code>fontRatio</code> size, and defaults to 1.45 (the recommended line-height for maximum legibility).~~ See <em>line-height</em> below.</p>

<p><code>javascript
$('body').flowtype({
   fontRatio : 30
});
</code></p>

<h3>Line-height</h3>

<p>In v1.0 of FlowType, we made the plugin set a specific line-height in pixels. We received many statements that setting a specific line-height is very dangerous. So, what did we do? We removed support for line-height in v1.1.</p>

<p>What do I do now? It’s quite simple: use unitless line-height in your CSS. It will make automatically make changes based on whatever the font-size. Here’s an example of what we suggest for <code>line-height</code>:</p>

<p><code>css
line-height: 1.45;
</code></p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Set Typography Base</h3>

<p>Prepare for FlowType.JS by making sure that the typography is flexible. Start with this CSS and make changes as necessary:</p>

<p>```css
body {
   font-size: 18px;
}</p>

<p>h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6,p {
   line-height: 1.45;
}</p>

<p>h1 { font-size: 4em; }
h2 { font-size: 3em; }
h3 { etc…
```</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> Setting a specific font-size in your CSS file will make sure that your website remains accessible in case your viewer has javascript disabled. These numbers will be overridden as FlowType.JS updates the font-size number inline.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Include FlowType.JS</h3>

<p>After you have downloaded FlowType.JS, include both jQuery and <code>flowtype.js</code> in the head of your HTML document.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Call FlowType.JS</h3>

<p>To begin the magic, simply call FlowType.JS before the close of your body tag:</p>

<p><code>javascript
$('body').flowtype();
</code></p>

<h3>Step 4: Make Changes</h3>

<p>You will most likely want to change the default settings. To do so, simply include these options in your code and tweak away:</p>

<p><code>javascript
$('body').flowtype({
   minimum   : 500,
   maximum   : 1200,
   minFont   : 12,
   maxFont   : 40,
   fontRatio : 30
});
</code></p>
